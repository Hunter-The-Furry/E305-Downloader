# e621/926 downloader

An application to download images from E621/e926.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher

## TODO

* Everything, I've decided to completely rewrite this so it isn't anywhere near as shit full of spaghetti code. I'll start with making it work via command line and go on from there

## Ideas

* Blacklist

* Pool downloading

* Download from list (Provide a list of tags and download post using each tag and some default parameters)

* GUI

* Less spaghetti

* Less memory leak
